```

Script to create a bootstrap null classification accuracy to compare with classification accuracy of actual treatments.

1. Subset to only control data

2. Combine all Control data 

3. Randomly select a peak for each RT for all the control data 

4. Do step 3. 5 times and call that control data

5. Do step 3. again 5 times  and call that exposure data

6. Run SVM-RFE on the 'null' control and 'null' exposure data

7. Repeat 1000x

8. Get a statistic (percentile/Z score?) to compare to your original results

Import data processed and retention time aligned with XCMS. 
Classes represent treatments.
1 = no pesticide, no predator
2 = pesticide, no predator
3 = no pesticide, predator
4 = pesticide, predator

```{r import aligned data}
# control vs. pesticide only
class <- read.csv("D:/git_repo/PIP/GCMS_data_XCMS/WorkDir_liver1/Preprocessing_Data_a/class.csv")
ProcessedTable <- read.csv("D:/git_repo/PIP/GCMS_data_XCMS/WorkDir_liver1/Preprocessing_Data_a/ProcessedTable.csv")
allliver<-cbind(class$V1, ProcessedTable)
allliver2<-allliver[order(class$V1),]
# drop classes 2 and 3
control_peaks<-allliver2[-11:-30,]

```

```{r randomly select a peak for each RT for all the control data}
# columns represent peaks, rows are individual liver samples
# create function to randomly select peak across rows for each column
# control_peaks2<-control_peaks[,-1:-2]
# number_of_peaks2<-dim(control_peaks2)[2]
# number_of_samples2<-dim(control_peaks2)[1]
# new_sample<-NULL
# for (j in 1:number_of_peaks){
#  row_x <- sample(1:number_of_samples, 1)
#  selected_peak_value<-control_peaks2[row_x,j]
#  new_sample[j]<-selected_peak_value
#  }

SET UP FEATURE RANKING FUNCTION
```{r}
#### create function for other R implementation of RFE for SVM ####
svmrfeFeatureRanking = function(x,y){
  n = ncol(x)
  survivingFeaturesIndexes = seq(1:n)
  featureRankedList = vector(length=n)
  rankedFeatureIndex = n
  while(length(survivingFeaturesIndexes)>0){
    #train the support vector machine
    svmModel = svm(x[, survivingFeaturesIndexes], y, cost = 6.4e9, gamma=1.0e-10, cachesize=500,
                   scale=F, type="C-classification", kernel="radial" )
    #compute the weight vector
    w = t(svmModel$coefs)%*%svmModel$SV
    #compute ranking criteria
    rankingCriteria = w * w
    #rank the features
    ranking = sort(rankingCriteria, index.return = TRUE)$ix
    #update feature ranked list
    featureRankedList[rankedFeatureIndex] = survivingFeaturesIndexes[ranking[1]]
    rankedFeatureIndex = rankedFeatureIndex - 1
    #eliminate the feature with smallest ranking criterion
    (survivingFeaturesIndexes = survivingFeaturesIndexes[-ranking[1]])
  }
  return (featureRankedList)
}
```


5. Run SVM-RFE on the 'null' control and 'null' exposure data

```{r}
#prepare data for RFE
X<-liver1_2[,-1:-2]
X<-X[,-1585]
Y<-liver1_2$Class
#RFE
featureRankedList <-svmrfeFeatureRanking(X,Y)
#SVM w/ RFE
svmModel = svm(X[, featureRankedList[1:100]], Y, cost = 1e10, gamma=1.0e-10, kernel="radial", cross=3 )
svmModel 
summary(svmModel)
print(svmModel)
```
